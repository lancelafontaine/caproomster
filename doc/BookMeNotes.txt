BookMe Notes:
- Due to time constraints and the difficulties in connecting the Mapper with 
  the rest of the code, we had to use the TDG directly for some functions.
- Assuming a perfect user will be using this app.
- The app was not thoroughly tested. Thus, it may contains unexpected bugs or crashes.
- The classes and methods mentioned in the SAD are implemented.
- Max duration of the reservation is 2 hours.
- Max number of reservations per day is 1 for 2 hours.
- Max number of reservation per week is 5 totaling for 10 hours.
- Although the waiting list can get updated and the user gets the reservation, 
  the user is not removed from any and all other waiting lists on any other room that 
  has been reserved over the same time slot. However, this is not an issue as 
  the max number of reservations per day is 1. Hence, the user won’t get any other 
  reservation on the same date when the waiting list get updated again.
